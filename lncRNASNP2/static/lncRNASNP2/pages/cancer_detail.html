            <li>A.46-Way Sequence Conservation: based on multiple sequence alignment scores, at the nucleotide level, of 46 vertebrate genomes compared with the human genome.</li>
            <li>B.Histone Modifications (ChIP-Seq): based on ChIP-Seq peak calls for histone modifications.</li>
            <li>C.Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS PeakSeq): based on PeakSeq peak calls for various transcription factors.</li>
            <li>D.Open Chromatin (DNase-Seq): based on DNase-Seq peak calls.</li>
            <li>E.100-Way Sequence Conservation: based on multiple sequence alignment scores, at the nucleotide level, of 100 vertebrate genomes compared with the human genome.</li>
            <li>F.GC Content: based on a single measure for GC content calculated using a span of five nucleotide bases from the UCSC Genome Browser.</li>
            <li>G.Open Chromatin (FAIRE): based on formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) peak calls.</li>
            <li>H.Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS SPP): based on SPP peak calls for various transcription factors.</li>
            <li>I.Genome Segmentation: based on genome-segmentation states using a consensus merge of segmentations produced by the ChromHMM and Segway software.</li>
            <li>J.Footprints: based on annotations describing DNA footprints across cell types from ENCODE.</li>
